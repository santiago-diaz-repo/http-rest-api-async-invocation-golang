# http-rest-api-versioning-golang

This project shows the two most popular ways to manage versioning in an API, they are Accept header and URL. Both ways are implementing based on json-api standard:

1. Sending header application/vnd.json+api;version=_number_ you can decide what version of response yoo want work with
2. Sending /v*number* you can decide what version of response yoo want work with

I left a postman collection, and a visual code project in order for you to test this API
